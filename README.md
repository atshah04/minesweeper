# minesweeper
This project is a simulation of minesweeper where the user can input a specific size of the board they would like to
use for the game. The game board is then randomized from the start every single time giving the user a new board. On each
iteration, the user can input specific coordinates for the board followed by F if they would like to flag this space, R if they
would like to reveal this space. The game will end once the user has revealed all possible spaces which are not the bomb in which
case they would win or they will reveal a bomb in which case the game would end.
